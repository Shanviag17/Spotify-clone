This project is a static front-end clone of the Spotify web app, created using only HTML and CSS. 
It mimics the design and layout of Spotify’s homepage, including the sidebar navigation, playlist section and album thumbnails. 
While it doesn’t include real music playback or functionality, it’s a great visual replica to showcase layout and styling skills.
